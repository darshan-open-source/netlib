#ifndef SETTINGS_INCLUDED
#define SETTINGS_INCLUDED

#define DEBUG    // for trace execution in development mode
#define USE_SSL  // for HTTPS

#define SESSION_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/temp_test/temp_sessions/"
#define UPLOADED_FILES_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/temp_files/"
#define DEFAULT_STATIC_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/static/"
#define BUILTIN_STATIC_DIRECTORY "/home/darshan/Documents/code/netlib(main)/default_statics/"
#endif
```

- generate cpp file for your website

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include "includes/webserver.h"
#include "includes/public_directory.h"
using namespace std;

RESPONSE admin(httpRequest req, httpResponse res, void *)
{

    return res.HttpResponse("hello from admin");
}

int main()
{

    webserver s("127.0.0.1", 8085);

    s.onRequest("/", "index.html");
    s.onRequest("/admin", admin);

    s.startServer();
    s.runServer();
}
